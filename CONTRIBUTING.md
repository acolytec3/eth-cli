## How Can I Contribute?

All contributions are welcome!

If you run into an issue, the first step is to report a problem or to suggest a new feature, [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/protofire/eth-cli/issues/new).
This will help the eth-cli maintainers become aware of the problem and prioritize a fix.

For code contributions, for either new features or bug fixes, see [Development](#development).

If you're looking to make a substantial change, you may want to reach out first to give us a heads up.

## Development

### Overview

This repository ([protofire/eth-cli](https://github.com/protofire/eth-cli)) is a collection of CLI tools to help with ethereum learning and development.

### Development Requirements

In order to develop eth-cli, you'll need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Getting Started

First clone this repository and install NPM dependencies:

    $ git clone git@github.com:protofire/eth-cli.git
    $ cd eth-cli
    $ npm install

### Forks, Branches, and Pull Requests

Community contributions to eth-cli require that you first fork the
repository you are modifying. After your modifications, push changes to your fork and submit a pull request upstream to `eth-cli`'s fork(s).

See GitHub documentation about [Collaborating with issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) for more information.

> :exclamation: **Note:** _eth-cli development uses a long-lived `master` branch for new (non-hotfix)
> development. Pull Requests should be opened against `master` in all
> repositories._

#### Branching Model

eth-cli project maintains one stable branch:

- **`master`**, for latest full releases and work targeting a patch release

#### Working on a Branch

Use a branch for your modifications, tracking it on your fork:

    $ git checkout -b feature/sweet-feature
    $ git push --set-upstream origin feature/sweet-feature

Then, make changes and commit as usual.

## Additional Notes

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:
